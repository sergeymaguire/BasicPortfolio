# BasicPortfolio
This website was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript.  It is a personalized website about me and what I have done on the front end side of programming.  Down below is the link so you can view it yourself and look at all the projects I have done and the skills I have as an employee.  As I do more projects and work I will continue to add them here.  This was fairly easy and simple to do other work I have done was harder and involved a good amount of javascript both front and backend.  Please take a look at this and let me know what you think, I have my email and phone number listed at the contact level which is the bottom of the page.
