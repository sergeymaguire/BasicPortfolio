# BasicPortfolio
This website was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript.  It is a personalized website about me and what I have done on the front end and backend side of programming.  Down below is the link so you can view it yourself, look at all the projects I have done, and the valuable skills I have as an employee.  As I do more projects and work I will continue to add them here.  This was fairly easy and simple to do other work I have done was harder and involved a good amount of javascript both front and backend.  Please take a look at this and let me know what you think, I have my email and phone number listed at the contact level which is the bottom of the page, a link to my resume which is at the about level, and links to my LinkedIn/Youtube/GitHub.
