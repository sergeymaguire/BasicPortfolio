# BasicPortfolio
This website was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript.  It is a personalized website about me and what I have done on the front end and backend side of programming.  Down below is the link so you can view it yourself, look at all the projects I have done, and the valuable skills I have as an employee.  As I do more projects and work I will continue to add them here.  This was fairly easy but time consuming and I actually leanred a lot more about bootstrap.  Other work I have done was harder and involved a good amount of javascript both front and backend.  Please take a look at this and let me know what you think, I have my email and phone number listed at the contact level which is the bottom of the page, a link to my resume which is at the about level, and links to my LinkedIn/Youtube/GitHub.  Another cool thing about this website is it is mobile friendly!  This will work on almost all phones big and small(tablets also) and look great with the layout looking nice, font size big enough to read and look nice, and the color putting no strain on your eyes.
